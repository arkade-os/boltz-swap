# Lightning Swaps

> Integrate Lightning Network with Arkade using Submarine Swaps

Arkade provides seamless integration with the Lightning Network through Boltz submarine swaps, allowing users to move funds between Arkade and Lightning channels. This integration leverages Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to ensure trustless and secure cross-chain atomic swaps.

## Overview

The Lightning swap integration extends Arkade's functionality by enabling:

1. **Lightning to Arkade swaps** - Receive funds from Lightning payments into your Arkade wallet
2. **Arkade to Lightning swaps** - Send funds from your Arkade wallet to Lightning invoices

This integration is built on top of the Boltz submarine swap protocol, providing a reliable and secure way to bridge the gap between Arkade and the Lightning Network.
